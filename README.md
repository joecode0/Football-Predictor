# Football-Predictor

This is all the code and other work produced for my Cambridge University Computer Science Tripos Part II Project. The Project is titled "Predicting the Outcomes of English Premier League Matches".

Data is collected via web-scraping and manual collection where more appropriate. The data is transformed into a small set of features, used to build models that solve the following problem:

Given multiple features of an English Premier League match that can only be known before the game begins, predict the outcome of the match from the options {H,D,A}. H = Home Win, D = Draw, A = Away Win.

The goal is to exceed a 40% accuracy rate. Expert pundits Mark Lawrenson and Paul Merson achieve a predicition accuracy of ~52%, and exceeding this would make the project a very successful one.

## Getting Started

Replicating the results is not an automatic process (for obvious reasons). All csv files are not uploaded, all that is uploaded is a) All code used, b) Organisation materials, c) Deliverables.

Inside this repository, the code is split into categories: Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Prep for Models, Models and Other. Each folder contains all the code used to work on that topic. There may be duplicate code used in multiple places. 

## Running the tests

As the nature of this project is experimental, there will be limited tests. However tests and automatic pipelines added at the end of the project will have their own folders, and more details will be added here then.
